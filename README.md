ArticleTools
============

Tools to make collaboration and citation graphs from a list of article DOIs

The tools currently consist of two Perl scripts:
./crossref.pl
and vaguely named:
./test.pl

The recommended first step is to find the DOIs for all the articles of interest and put them in a text file, one per line.
